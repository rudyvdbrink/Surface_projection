# Surface projection
 
This package contains matlab code to project volumetric nifti images in 2mm isotropic MNI space (example in folder 'volumetric') to the HCP MMP surface, and extract values of each parcel in the Glasser atlas (see example.m for syntax). 

In order for this code to run, you need:

 - An installed version of the human connectome workbench software (link)
 - Fieldtrip (link)
 - Edit the relevant lines in the functions so that these packages are found by matlab
